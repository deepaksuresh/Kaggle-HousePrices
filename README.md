# Kaggle-HousePrices
This is my solution to the kaggle competition:[House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
The dataset can be downloaded from the link above. 
There are two notebooks:
1. `PreProcessing&Exploration` deals with cleaning the data and dealing with missing values, it also generates and saves some nifty plots
2. The file `NeuralNetwork` contains a pure numpy implementation of neural network for regression
